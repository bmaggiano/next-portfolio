              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
              <p>Every year, the week before Christmas, our company does something I had heard a lot about — but never experienced until now: <strong>Hackathon Week</strong>.</p>
              <p>I wasn’t here last year. I got hired in January, which meant I completely missed the previous December hackathon. So walking into this week? This was my <strong>first one</strong>.</p>
              <p>No Jira alerts. No platform fires (hopefully). No day-to-day grind. Just a full week where engineers can work on <em>whatever they want</em>.</p>
              <p>For a platform team, this is a massive change of pace. Instead of maintaining systems and handling the unglamorous but necessary work, we get to build something fun — something creative — something a little unhinged.</p>
              <p>I was immediately all in.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Idea</blockquote>
              <p>The concept started simple and escalated very quickly.</p>
              <p>A TikTok-style feed — but inside our platform, and built specifically for <strong>education</strong>. Short-form learning. Scrollable videos. Bite-sized knowledge.</p>
              <p>Then we added <strong>AI-generated educational videos</strong>. Because of course we did.</p>
              <p>Then we decided to bring a <strong>video editor</strong> directly into the platform.</p>
              <p>All within a week.</p>
              <p>No pressure.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Team</blockquote>
              <p>One of the coolest parts of this being my first hackathon is getting to work with engineers <strong>outside of my normal team</strong>.</p>
              <p>I’m collaborating with people I don’t usually work with — including some seriously talented, higher-up engineers. It’s been an incredible opportunity to learn, observe, and contribute in a totally different environment.</p>
              <p>It’s also been a real-time check on my own growth: how I communicate technical ideas, how quickly I can ramp up, and how confident I feel contributing in a room full of smart people.</p>
              <p>And honestly? I feel like I belong.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Momentum</blockquote>
              <p>We’ve made a wild amount of progress in just two days.</p>
              <p>Things get explained once — and I pick them up. I’m able to make decisions when asked what I think. I’ve even had moments where I got to explain technical concepts that other engineers hadn’t heard of before.</p>
              <p>That kind of moment hits differently — especially during your first hackathon.</p>
              <p>We’re moving fast, collaborating within the team, pulling in other teams when needed, and constantly building on each other’s ideas. The feedback loop is tight. The execution is fast.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Vibes</blockquote>
              <p>There’s something special about building without the usual constraints.</p>
              <p>No overthinking. No endless refinement. Just shipping ideas, testing assumptions, and seeing how far you can push something in a short amount of time.</p>
              <p>Add in a little competition — since the winning team gets a prize and eternal bragging rights — and suddenly everyone’s firing on all cylinders.</p>
              <p>The vibes are genuinely great: motivated, collaborative, supportive, and just competitive enough.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway</blockquote>
              <p>For my first hackathon, this experience has been a massive confidence boost.</p>
              <p>It’s a reminder that growth doesn’t always come from grinding harder — sometimes it comes from changing the environment. From building something new. From working with new people. From giving yourself permission to experiment.</p>
              <p>Two days in, and I’m already proud of what we’ve built. No matter how it ends, this week has reminded me why I love engineering in the first place.</p>
              <p>Now let’s see if we can take the whole thing home.</p>

      "On learning, losing, and carrying forward the lessons from the mentors who shaped my career.",
    image: "/mentor.jpg",
    blogImage: "/mentor.jpg",
    readTime: 6,
    content: `
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
              <p>One of the hardest parts about working in tech—the part no one really warns you about—is that the people who shape you the most don’t always stay forever.</p>
              <p>Companies change. Teams shift. People move on to new opportunities or new chapters in their lives. And even when you stay in touch, losing day-to-day access to mentors who guided you is a quiet kind of heartbreak.</p>
              <p>When I first joined this company, I barely knew Rails, barely knew the ecosystem, and barely understood half of what was happening around me. But what I did have was <strong>exceptional mentorship</strong> from two very different, equally impactful people.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Two Styles</blockquote>
              <p>They couldn’t have been more different.</p>
  
              <p><strong>One was our team lead.</strong> Hands-off, no-nonsense, zero sugarcoating. He always called it how it was—blunt, direct, and unapologetically honest. If a story was unclear or missing half the requirements, he didn’t hesitate to tell product to “f*** off” (politely… but also not). He taught me the value of being upfront, of setting boundaries, and of not dancing around the truth.</p>
              
              <p>At the same time, despite the tough exterior, he had incredible emotional intelligence when it mattered. I’ll never forget the day I made a massive coding mistake—like, “my face instantly turned pale and I contemplated my life choices” level of mistake. I had tangled a bunch of user accounts, and I felt like I was going to throw up.</p>
  
              <p>Even with his reputation for bluntness, he knew exactly how to read the moment. He cracked some jokes, eased the tension, and jumped right in to help fix it. No guilt-tripping, no heat, just guidance. I walked away with the problem solved, but also with a lesson in leadership I’ve carried with me ever since.</p>
  
              <br/>
  
              <p><strong>The other mentor was almost the opposite.</strong> He sat on the other side of the office. Whenever I was stuck—learning the system, learning Rails, learning literally everything—I’d walk over with my laptop. He’d slide his headphones off, give me a light roast (a tradition at this point), and then genuinely walk me through the problem.</p>
  
              <p>Every time I left his desk, I felt like I’d gained both technical knowledge and institutional knowledge. He had patience, humor, and a way of explaining things that made everything click. He’s at a different company now, but we still play video games together. That says everything you need to know.</p>
  
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Impact</blockquote>
              <p>These two people taught me more than just code. They taught me what it means to be a good engineer, a good teammate, and a good human in a field that demands both technical and interpersonal skill.</p>
              <p>Different styles. Different strengths. Same influence.</p>
              <p>And losing them from my day-to-day work life? Yeah… it’s tough. Really tough. You don’t realize how much you lean on someone until their chair is empty.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Perspective</blockquote>
              <p>But this is the reality of tech. People grow. People leave. And the best mentors don’t stay forever—because their impact stays with you even when they’re gone.</p>
              <p>It’s bittersweet, but it’s also part of the process. And if anything, it’s a reminder of how lucky I was to have them in the first place.</p>
              <br/>
  
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Legacy</blockquote>
              <p>The only thing left to do now is carry what they taught me into the next stage of my career. Apply their lessons. Blend their styles. And when the next wave of junior devs comes through, be the person they can count on the same way I counted on my mentors.</p>
              <p>Because mentorship doesn’t end when someone leaves—it continues through the people they influenced.</p>
              <p>And I hope I can do justice to both of them.</p>

      "How a company fitness competition reminded me why competing is still one of the best ways to grow.",

    readTime: 5,
    content: `
                  <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
                  <p>I didn’t expect to get drafted into a <strong>company fitness competition</strong>, but here we are. One minute I’m writing code, the next minute I’m getting recruited like it’s 2009 AAU basketball all over again.</p>
                  <p>Each team had five people. Ten events total. And a generous <em>two weeks</em> to prepare. You know—plenty of time to become elite at everything from pull-ups to wall sits.</p>
                  <p>I already work out six days a week, play basketball, lift, do football stuff… but nothing says “you’re not as well-rounded as you think” like a competition that includes <strong>battle ropes</strong>, <strong>Z presses</strong>, and <strong>a farmers carry designed by someone who hates shoulders.</strong></p>
                  <br/>
      
                  <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Events</blockquote>
                  <p>The lineup felt like the Olympics for people who own too many tech hoodies:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pull-Ups</li>
                    <li>Dips</li>
                    <li>Sit-Ups</li>
                    <li>Dead Hang</li>
                    <li>Z Press</li>
                    <li>Battle Ropes</li>
                    <li>Smith Machine Squats</li>
                    <li>Wall Sit</li>
                    <li>Push-Ups</li>
                    <li>Farmers Carry</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I ended up doing <strong>Battle Ropes</strong> and <strong>Z Press</strong>. If you’ve never done battle ropes for time, let me tell you: it’s the fastest way to find out if your lungs actually like you.</p>
                  <br/>
      
                  <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Competition</blockquote>
                  <p>Both teams showed up ready. Some people trained. Others claimed they trained. Some of us definitely realized halfway through that we should’ve trained differently.</p>
                  <p>Every event was close. People were screaming, cheering, pretending they weren’t dying inside — classic team bonding stuff.</p>
                  <p>And after all ten events? We fell just short. Barely.</p>
                  <p>Honestly? Losing might’ve been the best thing that could’ve happened.</p>
                  <br/>
      
                  <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Spark</blockquote>
                  <p>The loss didn’t bother me — it <strong>motivated</strong> me. Because competition has a funny way of exposing all the little weaknesses you forget about when you’re lifting or hooping on your own schedule.</p>
                  <p>It reminded me that fitness isn’t just about strength or endurance — it’s about adaptability, teamwork, and sometimes learning that your shoulder mobility is not what you thought it was.</p>
                  <p>I walked in confident and walked out inspired to get better at the things I usually avoid — the awkward, uncomfortable, “why does this burn so much?” movements.</p>
                  <br/>
      
                  <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Lesson</blockquote>
                  <p>These kinds of events are more than just a break from Jira alerts and desk life. They’re a surprisingly fun way to meet people, build relationships, and remember that work doesn’t always have to be… work.</p>
                  <p>If your company sets up something like this, I’d say go for it. Even if you have two weeks to prepare. Even if the events make no sense. Even if you “aren't built for wall sits.”</p>
                  <p>You might come away sore. You might come away humbled. But you’ll definitely come away better.</p>
                  <p>And hey — there’s always next year.</p>

      "Balancing outages, deadlines, PRs, and priorities — learning to switch gears without losing momentum.",

    blogImage: "/context.jpg",
    readTime: 6,
    content: `
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
              <p>Lately, my days have felt like one long mental juggling act. Between <strong>Jira alerts</strong>, story work, helping another team hit their deadline, and reviewing PRs, it feels like I’m constantly bouncing between tasks that all need attention <em>right now</em>.</p>
              <p>Some days, I look up and realize it’s 4 PM, and the one thing I meant to focus on in the morning hasn’t even been opened yet. Classic.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Observation</blockquote>
              <p>I’ve noticed how senior engineers handle this — and it’s impressive. They don’t just survive context switching; they <strong>navigate</strong> it. I’ve watched them help me debug something tricky, then jump straight back into their own projects like nothing happened. It’s like they have a mental switchboard that’s always on standby.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I’ll spend twenty minutes trying to remember where I left off after switching tabs. It’s humbling — but it’s also part of learning.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Struggle</blockquote>
              <p>Right now, I’m splitting my time between helping another team with a critical deadline, managing outages, and supporting a product that basically keeps our entire department employed. It’s rewarding work — but it’s also a lot. </p>
              <p>There are moments where I can feel my focus stretching thin, and that’s where the challenge really lives: figuring out how to shift gears without losing traction.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Lesson</blockquote>
              <p>I’m learning that context switching isn’t about doing everything at once — it’s about <strong>resetting quickly</strong>. It’s knowing when to shift, when to delegate, and when to lock in and say, “This gets my focus right now.”</p>
              <p>Every interruption is an opportunity to get better at reprioritizing. And honestly, the more you practice it, the easier it gets. Kind of like building mental muscle memory.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway</blockquote>
              <p>I’m still not great at it — I probably spend too much time on the wrong things sometimes — but I know it’ll come with experience. Watching how senior engineers handle this has been its own kind of mentorship. They make it look effortless, not because it is, but because they’ve trained themselves to move fluidly between chaos and calm.</p>
              <p>And that’s what I’m working toward: being adaptable without being overwhelmed. Productive, but still present.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <p>Eventually, I’ll get there. One context switch at a time.</p>

      "How staying positive during outages turned chaos into trust — and why optimism matters more than you think.",

    readTime: 6,
    content: `
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
              <p>Some days, it feels like my job description could just read: “Keep calm while everything breaks.”</p>
              <p>Being a software engineer sounds exciting on paper — until your version of excitement involves a flood of <strong>Jira alerts</strong> lighting up your screen. Systems go down, users can’t log in, something that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly refuses to cooperate.</p>
              <p>It’s not always glamorous work. In fact, a lot of what my team does falls into the “dirty work” category — the unplanned, unexpected, and often thankless stuff that keeps the company running.</p>
              <p>But here’s the thing: <strong>I actually love it.</strong></p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Question</blockquote>
              <p>I get asked a lot — usually mid-incident — how I manage to stay so positive when things are falling apart. </p>
              <p>It’s not that I find outages fun (no one does). It’s that I genuinely believe in our ability to figure it out. After a while, you stop panicking when things break. You just roll up your sleeves and start fixing. And that’s what optimism really is — not ignoring the chaos, but trusting that the chaos is temporary.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Mindset</blockquote>
              <p>There’s this misconception that optimism means pretending everything’s fine. It doesn’t. For me, it’s about showing up steady when everything else feels unstable.</p>
              <p>Someone once told me, “Energy is contagious.” And in our world, that couldn’t be truer. If one person spirals, it spreads. But if one person stays calm — if one person reminds the team that we’ve solved harder problems before — it creates space for focus.</p>
              <p>Sometimes that’s all people need: a small reminder that the world isn’t ending, just glitching for a bit.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Trust</blockquote>
              <p>The funny thing about staying positive during outages is that people start to trust you more — not because you’re the loudest or the smartest in the room, but because you’re consistent.</p>
              <p>Positivity doesn’t fix bugs, but it builds reliability. It creates this quiet confidence that no matter what breaks, your team can handle it. And that trust compounds over time.</p>
              <p>When your team is known for being steady under pressure, opportunities follow. You start to see more story work, more ownership, more responsibility — because you’ve proven you can keep things together when it matters most.</p>
              <br/>
      
              <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Lesson</blockquote>
              <p>I’ve always been an optimistic person by nature, but the more I work in engineering, the more I realize it’s also a skill — one you practice every day.</p>
              <p>You can choose to dwell on what’s broken, or you can focus on the fact that you get to fix things that matter. Because underneath every outage, every alert, every “hey, this is broken again,” there’s something quietly satisfying about being the person people can count on.</p>
              <p>Maybe that’s the real power of optimism: it keeps you grounded long enough to turn chaos into progress.</p>

          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
          <p>Some weeks feel like a sprint inside a marathon. Between my full-time job, continuing education classes for my real estate license, planning a Halloween party for twenty-something guests, and getting ready to host a couple of friends for the weekend — life’s been... busy. And that’s not even counting family time or the fact that my brother’s about to have a baby. (Wild.)</p>
          <br/>
      
          <p>Every day lately feels like a different kind of juggling act. Finish work. Jump into a class. Decorate the house. Run errands. Text reminders. Somewhere in there, try to eat something that’s not just caffeine and adrenaline. It’s been a lot — but it’s also been kind of awesome.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Grind</blockquote>
          <p>I’ve always loved being busy. There’s something energizing about movement — about progress. Checking boxes, finishing projects, building things, bringing people together. It’s what keeps me feeling alive and motivated.</p>
          <p>But the truth is, even good busy can sneak up on you. One minute you’re thriving on the chaos, and the next, you’re realizing you haven’t had a real break in weeks. You start running on autopilot — productive, but not present.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Pause</blockquote>
          <p>It hit me the other night while I was finalizing the Halloween playlist at 11:45 PM — I was exhausted, but my brain refused to slow down. I wasn’t stressed in the traditional sense, but I was definitely drained. That’s when it clicked: even when life is full of things you *like* doing, it’s still okay to pause.</p>
          <p>Burnout doesn’t always come from hating what you do. Sometimes, it comes from loving it too much to step away.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Lesson</blockquote>
          <p>I’m learning that rest isn’t just something you earn — it’s something you practice. Scheduling downtime doesn’t make you lazy; it makes you sustainable. Whether it’s taking an hour to go on a walk, turning your phone off for a bit, or just saying “I’ll deal with that tomorrow,” it all adds up.</p>
          <p>Because the truth is, if you don’t make space to breathe, you’ll eventually run out of air — no matter how much you love the grind.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Fun</blockquote>
          <p>At the same time, I can’t deny how fun this kind of chaos can be. The party planning, the late-night work, the juggling — it’s all part of building a life that’s full. And even though I’m learning to rest more intentionally, I still love the feeling of being “in it.” There’s something deeply satisfying about doing hard things, staying organized, and making it all come together.</p>
          <p>Balance doesn’t mean slowing down — it just means knowing when to speed back up.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Looking Back</blockquote>
          <p>Life doesn’t always wait for the “perfect time.” Sometimes, everything hits at once — the work, the projects, the milestones, the parties, the people. But that’s also what makes it beautiful. The key is learning to find rhythm in the chaos — to know when to push, when to pause, and when to just sit back and take it all in.</p>
          <p>This season’s been busy, messy, rewarding, and exhausting all at once. But it’s mine — and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>

          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
          <p>This week, my teammate and I were deep in the weeds trying to figure out why data was flowing from <strong>PowerSchool → Central</strong>, but not from <strong>PowerSchool → Canvas</strong>. We had part of the puzzle—some diagrams, a few assumptions, and just enough context to feel like we could piece it together.</p>
          <p>So we dove in. We traced logs, checked adapters, and confirmed configurations. Everything <em>looked</em> right. But users still weren’t syncing into Canvas.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Turning Point</blockquote>
          <p>After a couple hours, it started to feel like we were just spinning our wheels. You know that moment when you’ve stared at something so long you start doubting your own sanity? Yeah, that was us.</p>
          <p>Eventually, we did the thing engineers are notoriously bad at: <strong>we asked for help.</strong></p>
          <p>Within ten minutes, someone pointed us toward a piece of the system we didn’t even know existed — a <strong>consumer</strong> sitting between the adapter and Canvas that we had completely overlooked. Suddenly, everything clicked.</p>
          <p>Once we saw that missing piece, the full flow made sense: <strong>PowerSchool → Consumer → SQS → Adapter → Canvas</strong>. From there, the fix was easy—and soon, users were flowing through like they should’ve been all along.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Lesson</blockquote>
          <p>Looking back, we did our due diligence. We time-boxed our investigation, explored our hypotheses, and reasoned through what we knew. That’s part of being an engineer.</p>
          <p>But there’s a fine line between <em>digging in</em> and <em>digging a hole</em>. Sometimes, the best debugging tool isn’t <code>puts</code> or <code>byebug</code>—it’s another person’s perspective.</p>
          <p>Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s a way to learn faster and get unblocked sooner. It’s collaboration in action.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Paying It Forward</blockquote>
          <p>Later that same day, a different coworker ran into the <em>exact same issue</em>. This time, we were the ones helping them connect the dots. It felt good to return the favor—and it made me realize how quickly knowledge spreads when people are willing to reach out.</p>
          <p>You don’t lose credibility by asking for help. You build it by sharing what you’ve learned.</p>
          <br/>
      
          <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Looking Back</blockquote>
          <p>Engineering isn’t just about writing code or fixing bugs. It’s about piecing together complex systems—both technical and human. Sometimes, the missing piece isn’t buried in a log or hidden behind an API. Sometimes, it’s sitting one chair away.</p>

    content: `
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Setup</blockquote>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I had to give a talk about our company’s entire ecosystem—over a dozen microservices—to the <strong>entire engineering department</strong>. These services spanned everything from <strong>Azure to AWS</strong>, built in <strong>C#, Python, Ruby on Rails, and .NET</strong>. Basically, a little bit of everything.</p>
      <br/>
      
      <p>And here’s the kicker: I’ve only been here nine months. When I joined, I didn’t know the architecture, the stack, or even the coding language we used. My background was all JavaScript—React and Node—and suddenly I was working in Ruby on Rails. It was a massive shift.</p>
      <br/>
      
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Challenge</blockquote>
      <p>This session, which I co-hosted with my coworker <strong>Spencer</strong>, was focused on <strong>user flow</strong>. We were tasked with walking everyone through how data moves through our systems from start to finish. I was equal parts excited and terrified.</p>
      <p>So I did what I could: I prepared. <em>A lot.</em> I built slides, created visuals in <strong>v0.dev</strong>, used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for imagery, and practiced over and over. By the time the day came, I was nervous—but the preparation paid off. Once I started talking, it felt less like a presentation and more like a <strong>rehearsal</strong>.</p>
      <br/>
      
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Talk</blockquote>
      <p>The talk went better than I could’ve hoped. We broke down each of the microservices, explained how everything connects, and painted a picture of our system’s user flow end-to-end. By the end, people were snapping photos of our diagram and asking if I could send the slides directly to them. That was such a surreal moment—realizing I’d gone from not knowing this ecosystem at all to explaining it to the people who built it.</p>
      <br/>
      
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway</blockquote>
      <p>If there’s one thing I learned from this experience, it’s that <strong>preparation builds confidence</strong>. The more effort you put in beforehand, the less scary the actual talk becomes. When you prepare deeply, the presentation itself just feels like another practice run.</p>
      <p>Anyone can give a great talk—no matter how new you are, no matter how nervous you feel—if you put in the work. Preparation gives you confidence, and confidence makes it feel natural.</p>
      <br/>
      
      <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Looking Back</blockquote>
      <p>Standing up in front of the entire department was intimidating, but it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had so far as an engineer. If you ever find yourself in my shoes—nervous, unsure, maybe a little out of your depth—just remember: it’s all about the work you do <em>before</em> you ever step up to the mic.</p>

        <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">From Startup to Scale-Up</blockquote>
<p>Changing careers is terrifying. You leave the comfort of what you know for the chaos of the unknown. For me, that leap took me from coding bootcamp to building software at scale—and it’s been the wildest ride of my life.</p>
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Healthcare Download</blockquote>
<p>My first stop as a software engineer was at a company called <strong>Healthcare Download</strong>, a team that took a chance on a kid fresh out of bootcamp.</p>
<p>There, I learned the fundamentals—building small features, deploying code, testing, and shipping changes into production. The ecosystem was simple: a few repos, a few junior devs, and straightforward processes. I felt like I was thriving.</p>
<p>After a year, I left with the confidence that I could jump into any environment and immediately be useful. Or so I thought.</p>
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Strongmind</blockquote>
<p>Next, I joined <strong>Strongmind</strong>, an edtech company filled with brilliant engineers. My first day delivered the biggest case of imposter syndrome I’d ever felt.</p>
<p>I was greeted with a diagram of the company’s entire ecosystem, which included:</p>
<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li>Ruby on Rails repos</li>
  <li>Python repos</li>
  <li>C# and .NET repos</li>
  <li>Event-driven architecture</li>
  <li>AWS and Azure</li>
  <li>Adapters everywhere</li>
  <li>Microservices</li>
  <li>CI/CD pipelines</li>
  <li>DLQs</li>
  <li>And arrows crisscrossing everything like a spiderweb</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>It was beautiful. And it was terrifying. I knew I was in for a ride.</p>
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Trial by Fire</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, I could feel this place was going to force me to grow in ways I hadn’t imagined. On the other hand, my confidence had just hit a new low.</p>

<p>That first month, I leaned hard on my teammates, asked countless questions, and put in long nights. Slowly, I started to feel more comfortable with Rails—setting up controller actions, working with views, and getting familiar with the framework itself.</p>

<p>But even as my Rails skills grew, my understanding of our overall systems was still painfully lacking. The repos, the integrations, the moving parts—it all felt like a massive puzzle I had only just begun to piece together.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was learning more than just code—I was learning processes, standups, planning, communication, team dynamics, and even how to hold my own during lunch conversations. The learning curve was brutal, but I refused to let it beat me.</p>
<br />

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Fast Forward</blockquote>
<p>Eight months later, I had my full-circle moment: I was asked to explain the user flow through our ecosystem to the entire engineering team.</p>
<p>If you’d told me on my first day that this would happen, I would’ve laughed in your face.</p>
<br/>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Looking Back</blockquote>
<p>The leap from startup to scale-up has been the hardest and most rewarding experience of my career so far.</p>
<p>If you’re standing on the edge of a career change, nervous about what’s on the other side—take the leap. You’ll be amazed at what you’re capable of.</p>

        <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Fantasy Football & AI</blockquote>
            <p>Fantasy football is one of the most exciting and stressful things to participate in year after year. It's also one of the most rewarding experiences if you're a fan of the sport. However, keeping up with every single player's stats year after year can get a little overwhelming. That's where the idea to combine fantasy football and AI come into play. Imagine an app that that can give you expert analysis... like Stuart Scott, as well as AI breakdowns for in depth analysis.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Stuart AI</blockquote>
            <p>Stuart AI is a fantasy football app that has access to every single play for every single player that dates all the way back to 1999. It integrates with your Sleeper Fantasy account and pulls in real-time data from your team's stats. the long term goal with this is to have a one stop shop for all of your fantasy football needs. League dues, payouts, AI analytics, and so much more. In its current state you're able to see your league history including playoffs, able to type in two players and get AI insights for their historical stats, as well as get on the early waitlist for the full list of AI features.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Player Compare</blockquote>
            <p>One of the biggest struggles week in and week out is figuring out who to start and who to bench in your fantasy lineups. A LOT of analysis goes into this, and if you're not familiar with fantasy football, let me spell out how complex of a decision just deciding between two players can be. Let's take for example these two players, Brock Purdy and Jordan Love. They're quaterbacks for their respective teams. Some things you would want to consider when deciding who to start and who to bench would be the following:</p>
            <br/>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>What are their current season stats?</li>
                <li>What are their previous season stats against this opponent?</li>
                <li>Are they healthy?</li>
                <li>Are their receivers healthy?</li>
                <li>Is their running back healthy?</li>
                <li>Are they dealing with any Oline injuries/issues?</li>
                <li>Is there any news that would sway my decision one way or the other?</li>
                <li>Is the weather going to be a factor?</li>
                <li>Does one have more rushing upside than the other?</li>
                <li>Are they playing against a really good defense?</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Now all of this is just for one position, for one week. Can you imagine the effort required to do this for every position in your fantasy team for every week? It's a lot to keep up with. Stuart AI gathers all the data for you, combines it into a nice prompt to pass to an AI model and then returns the results. Not to mention it presents nice visual charts/graphs to help you make educated decisions if you don't want to fully rely on the AI. Also to help reduce calls and costs, we use Redis to cache data frequently and improve load times throughout the entire application. Users can currently make 10 calls per day to the API (gpt4.0-mini) and we're currently working on implementing tiered pricing structures to make it customizable for users.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Parlai</blockquote>
            <p>All of this fantasy football frenzy got us thinking that we can not only create AI player comparisons, but since we're gathering all of the player info anyway, wouldn't it be cool to see if we could help users with their sports bets as well? Currently users have the ability to check live prop odds for NFL players and see if it's wise to bet the over or under on those prop bets. In the future we plan to also allow users to create parlays to see which bets make sense and which don't.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Tech</blockquote>
            <p>Building this has given me a chance to really learn the ins and outs of AI SDKs, ShadCN, NextJS, Redis, Postgres and so many more design systems. It's given me a chance to collaborate with industry experts and learn from them. I'm really excited to see where this goes and what other cool things I can build with AI.</p>

            <p>My journey began in March of 2022 when I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.
            The decision was not an easy one coming from 7 years of Real Estate experience, but with an enormous amount of 
            support from family and friends, I decided to enroll through the university of Arizona's full stack coding bootcamp.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">09/2022</blockquote>
            <p>The bootcamp was from September 2022 until December 2022 and was set to progress at an extremely fast rate. My parents decided to take me under their wing and take me through a pre course cirriculum to try to prepare me for such an edndeavor. So from April 21, 2022 when I wrote my first line of code until the start of the bootcamp I had already become familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, Node, MySQL, Express, and a good number of concepts in between. Fast forward to December 2022 and I had graduated with a certificate at the top of my class. I was so excited for what the future would hold, and couldn't wait to start my journey into the world of software engineering.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">01/2023</blockquote>
            <p>The next few months were a whirlwind of learning and growth. I was able to take on an internship with one of my best friends and work alongside him to build fun AI projects with real world applications. Not only that, but I also got a chance to see how hard it is to find a first job in the tech industry. Over the course of 3 months I ended up submitting about 150 applications with only 2 interviews. And finally, the opportunity presented itself... I was offered a 3 month long unpaid internship at a small startup called HCDL (Healthcare Download). I knew that if I could work hard and persevere, there might be a path to employment. Low and behold, after 2 months into my 3 month internship, I was offered a full time poisiton at HCDL!</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">08/2023</blockquote>
            <p>During my time at HCDL I learned a lot about the tech industry and how to work within a team environment. Countless hours of front end, back end, full stack, customer service, B2B relationship building, and more taught me what it really means to be a software engineer in a startup environment. This really ramped up my skill set until the bittersweet moment that it was time to part ways with HCDL.</p>

            <p>Upon graduating from the University of Arizona's full stack coding bootcamp, I was struggling to find opportunities for newly graduated students. In order to expand my skillset and gain experience, I decided to take on an unpaid internship with one of my best friends. This internship was a great opportunity to finally adapt some AI into my projects and learn a lot about the tech industry.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">The Fork</blockquote>
            <p>Initially this project started off by being a fork from https://github.com/Nutlope/twitterbio repo to help users create twitter bios based on a prompt. This then evolved into an idea. What if I could take an image, a prompt, and help users create instagram captions based on different styles of popluar online presences. The fork was easy, the rest was a bit more involved. As this was the first AI project that I was going to work on, I really had to understand the OpenAI API model and how to use it. I also had to understand more about image urls and how it would even be possible to upload an image and get a response back depecting what was in that image. To my noob, post grad, mind... this seemed impossible. Luckily I had a friend in the field who held my hand through the process.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Success</blockquote>
            <p>After about a week or so of building, I was finally able to use a variety of tech and storage solutions to get this thing working. One of the biggest issues we faced was how to store and display that image back to the user to let them know their image had been successfully uploaded. There were some ideas:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Use local storage to store the image as a base64 string</li>
                <li>Use a database to store the image and the prompt</li>
                <li>Use a file system to store the image and the prompt</li>
                <li>Use an upcoming tech called Uploadthings to store the image and the prompt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We decided to try local storage at first, but the strings were actually too long and it ended up impossible to store them there. So eventually we settled with trying https://uploadthing.com/. Built to be a better S3, this seemed like a quick efficient solution. We were able to get the image and the prompt back to the user and display it in the UI. The user can then click the "Generate Caption" button and see the caption generated by the AI. This was a huge success and I'm really proud of the work that I did.</p>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Looking forward</blockquote>
            <p>As the technology for image recognition and AI in general continues to improve, there is ample opportunity to update these projects to make them ever better and more sophisticated. I'm excited to see what the future holds for these projects and how they can continue to evolve and improve.</p>
