    <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">03/2022</blockquote>
            <p>My journey began in March of 2022 when I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.
            The decision was not an easy one coming from 7 years of Real Estate experience, but with an enormous amount of 
            support from family and friends, I decided to enroll through the university of Arizona's full stack coding bootcamp.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">09/2022</blockquote>
            <p>The bootcamp was from September 2022 until December 2022 and was set to progress at an extremely fast rate. My parents decided to take me under their wing and take me through a pre course cirriculum to try to prepare me for such an edndeavor. So from April 21, 2022 when I wrote my first line of code until the start of the bootcamp I had already become familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, Node, and a good number of concepts in between. Fast forward to December 2022 and I had graduated with a certificate at the top of my class. I was so excited for what the future would hold, and couldn't wait to start my journey into the world of software engineering.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">12/2022</blockquote>
            <p>The next few months were a whirlwind of learning and growth. I was able to take on an internship with one of my best friends and work alongside him to build fun AI projects with real world applications. Not only that, but I also got a chance to see how hard it is to find a first job in the tech industry. Over the course of 3 months I ended up submitting about 150 applications with only 2 interviews. And finally, the opportunity presented itself... I was offered a 3 month long unpaid internship at a small startup called HCDL (Healthcare Download). I knew that if I could work hard and persevere, there might be a path to employment. Low and behold, after 2 months into my 3 month internship, I was offered a full time poisiton at HCDL.!</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">08/2023</blockquote>
            <p>During my time at HCDL I learned a lot about the tech industry and how to work within a team environment. Countless hours of front end, back end, full stack, customer service, B2B relationship building, and more taught me what it really means to be a software engineer in a startup environment. This really ramped up my skill set until the bittersweet moment that it was time to part ways with HCDL.</p>
            <br/>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Today</blockquote>
            <p>I'm currently looking for a position as a software engineer in any team environment. I'm passionate about building beautiful looking, fully functional sites, and excited to explore any opportunity that comes my way.</p>
